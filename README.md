# UEproject_0.1

🎮 Unreal Engine 5 Blueprint Game Prototype  
_A project focused on gameplay mechanics built entirely using Blueprints._

## 📌 Project Overview

UEproject_0.1 is a game prototype developed using Unreal Engine 5. This project primarily explores core gameplay mechanics including:

- 📉 Stamina and XP management systems  
- 💥 Enemy health logic and UI updates
